                <h2>College Of Engineering Roorkee,Rookee</h2>
                <h4>(Affiliated to Uttrakhand Technical University Dehradun)</h4>
                <p>
                    COER University is located in Roorkee, Uttarakhand on the Delhi-Haridwar National Highway-58, 7 km from Roorkee.
                    Roorkee is about 180 km north of Delhi and is known as the gateway town to the picturesque Himalayan Ranges.
                    It has the famous Ganga canal, a civil engineering marvel of the 19th century, passing through it.
                    Besides, the presence of the iconic institutions – IIT Roorkee, Central Building Research Institute, National Institute of Hydrology, Irrigation Research Institute, Bengal Engineers Group and Centre of Indian Army truly makes it an engineers’ town.
                    Founded by Seth Roshan Lal Jain Trust in 1998 as the first private Engineering College in Roorkee and the only engineering institution other than the famed University of Roorkee (now IIT Roorkee),
                    COER grew by leaps and bounds in the past 24 years under the visionary and dynamic leadership of its founder Chairman Er. JC Jain, a postgraduate (M.E.) in Industrial Engineering from BITS Pilani (1971)
                    and an eminent industrialist. On 15th February 2021, the Government of Uttarakhand State has approved COER University as State Private University.
                    The COER University carries the legacy of COER. The COER University aims to be the premier university in the state of Uttarakhand and a peerless champion in the world of facilitator of technical, management and agriculture education.

                <p>
                    The guiding principle has been to establish standards of uncompromising excellence in teaching and research.
                    The University campus is meticulously designed and built and presents a beautiful sight on the busy highway.
                    Spread over 75 acres and draped in predominantly white exterior, the academic, administrative and residential
                    buildings present a welcoming ambience to this temple of learning.

                    The university aims to introduce students to the world of emerging technologies, instilling in them the confidence to face new challenges and enabling them to shine in their chosen fields.
                    With innovative infrastructure, exceptional international collaborations and an immersive research-driven academic environment, we provide an education that is well-rounded,
                    extensive and practical. COER University believes in the all-round development of its students and leaves no stone unturned to achieve this.
